# ChangeLog for honeypottery

## Version 0.0.5 (2016-03-24)
  - add option to read the API key from a file
    This way the API key will not appear in the process list and/or shell
    history. However, the file name can still be  seen, so proper file
    permissions should be set to avoid that other users can read the API key.

## Version 0.0.4 (2015-12-06)
  - fix typo in error message

## Version 0.0.3 (2015-11-15)
  - fix typos in help text

## Version 0.0.2 (2015-08-30)
  - remove unnecessary output line

## Version 0.0.1 (2015-08-29)
  - initial version
